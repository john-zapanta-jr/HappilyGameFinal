Despite a rocky beginning...
Your relationship with John continued
to blossom.  You two eventually move
to Woodland and live in your grandma's
backyard while John finishes school and
eventually you discover your passion for
picking up dog poop...
Just kidding... well I don't want to spoil the surprise
but you're top in your field.
And because you picked mean choices in the
game he made for you, you don't get a puppy.
And also... the game looks scary..
BOO!
I love you, merry christmas - John
