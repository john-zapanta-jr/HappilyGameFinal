Your relationship with John continued
to blossom.  You two eventually move
to Woodland and live in your grandma's
backyard while John finishes school and
eventually you discover your passion for
... well I don't want to spoil the surprise
but you're top in your field.
And because you picked nice choices to
show your appreciation for the game he made
you, you get a puppy! 
not in real life though, sorry haha.
I love you, merry christmas - John
